A fully responsive **e-commerce UI clone** inspired by a local pharmacy store. This project was created as part of a **technical test** to showcase skills in modern **React development**, routing, and responsive component-based UI using **TailwindCSS** and **Vite**.

It includes dynamic menus, product sliders, a mobile navigation drawer, and a custom **extra product page** at `/item-crema-ponds` beyond the scope of the original requirements.
